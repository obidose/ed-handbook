## :material-account-search: Selecting a Patient

### Default Process

!!! example "Finding Your Next Patient"
    1. **Organise WebPAS by time order**
    2. **Look for the patient who has been waiting the longest** who has not yet been seen by a clinician
    3. This is by default the **next patient you should see**

### Area Allocation

!!! warning "Stick to Your Assigned Area"
    - If you are allocated to work in a **specific area**, only see patients in that area
    - If there are **no patients waiting** in your area:
        - **Do not just wait**
        - Talk to the **senior in charge of your area** or **EPIC**
        - You may be able to flex and see patients in another area

## :material-alert-circle: Priority Patients

### Status 1 - Immediate

!!! danger "Critical Patients"
    - **Status 1 patients** will generally be known about before arrival and already pre-allocated
    - If there is a Status 1 patient with **no clinician allocated**:
        - Attend them **first**
        - They will need **early senior input** from the outset
        - Involve a senior immediately

### Status 2 - Within 10 Minutes

!!! warning "Urgent Patients"
    - **Status 2 patients** need seeing sooner, but not always at the expense of all other patients
    - **Ask the EPIC or senior** for your area if they would rather you see a Status 2 patient first
    - Balance urgency with overall department flow

## :material-account-edit: Claiming a Patient

!!! success "Critical Step"
    Once you have selected a patient:
    
    **Put your name in the clinician section of WebPAS**
    
    - Do this **before** looking at any results or background
    - This claims responsibility for the patient
    - Ensures everyone knows who is managing them

---

## :material-file-search: Background Review

!!! tip "Quick Background Check"
    After claiming the patient, review:
    
    - **Clinical Portal** - Previous presentations and medical history
    - **Investigations already done** - Any results available
    - **However, do not spend long doing this**
    
    The priority is to **see the patient and get the history**. You can look into more background after you have information about the presenting complaint.

## :material-stethoscope: Initial Patient Assessment

Once you've claimed a patient, it's time to assess them and formulate your plan.

!!! info "Next Steps"
