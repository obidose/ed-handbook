# Calcium Calculator

> Quick converter for calcium dosing. Calculate the volume and vials needed for both calcium gluconate and calcium chloride formulations.

!!! info "Clinical Context"
    Two calcium formulations are commonly used in emergency medicine:
    
    - **Calcium Gluconate 10%**: 2.23 mmol Ca²⁺ in 10 mL (0.223 mmol/mL)
    - **Calcium Chloride 10%**: 6.8 mmol Ca²⁺ in 10 mL (0.68 mmol/mL)
    
    **Important:** The mmol values refer to calcium **ions** (Ca²⁺), which is the clinically useful measure. The total compound mmol differs from the ion concentration.

!!! note "Key Points"
    - **Calcium chloride** contains ~3× more calcium ions per mL than calcium gluconate
    - Both are 10% w/v solutions (1 g in 10 mL)
    - Calcium chloride is more caustic and should be given via central line when possible
    - Calcium gluconate is preferred for peripheral administration
    - Always verify doses and formulation before administration
