!!! info "Clinical Context"
    Two calcium formulations are commonly used in emergency medicine:
    
    - **Calcium Gluconate 10%**: 2.23 mmol Ca²⁺ (93 mg elemental) in 10 mL (0.223 mmol/mL)
    - **Calcium Chloride 10%**: 6.8 mmol Ca²⁺ (272 mg elemental) in 10 mL (0.68 mmol/mL)
    
    **Important:** The mmol values refer to calcium **ions** (Ca²⁺), which is the clinically useful measure. The total compound mmol differs from the ion concentration.

!!! note "Key Points"
    - **Calcium chloride** contains ~3× more calcium ions per mL than calcium gluconate
    - Both are 10% w/v solutions (1 g of compound in 10 mL)
    - Calcium chloride is more caustic and should be given via central line when possible
    - Calcium gluconate is preferred for peripheral administration
    - The calculator accepts input in mmol Ca²⁺, mg elemental calcium, or mL of either preparation
    - Always verify doses and formulation before administration
