## :material-information: Key Principles

!!! note "Important Points"
    - ~3% of children <3 years with fever >38.9°C have serious bacterial infection
    - Young febrile children often present with non-specific changes in behaviour and appearance
    - Height of fever, rapidity of onset, and response to antipyretics are **not** good indicators of severity
    - Simple febrile convulsions are **not** associated with increased risk for serious sepsis
    - Senior medical staff are available to assist with clinical decision making

## :material-baby: Age-Based Management

### Children Under 28 Days - Any Fever

!!! danger "High Risk Group"
    Bacterial infection in ~15% with possibility of rapidly progressive disease

**Full sepsis work up required:**

- Urine (CSU, clean catch, or SPA - see MDHB-420)
- Blood cultures
- FBC
- CSF (see contraindications below)
- CXR

**Admit for IV antibiotics:**

| Antibiotic | Dose | Frequency |
|------------|------|-----------|
| **Amoxicillin** | 50 mg/kg/dose | Q8H (1st week)<br>Q6H (>1 week) |
| **Cefotaxime** | Load: 100 mg/kg<br>Then: 50 mg/kg/dose | Q12H (1st week)<br>Q6H (>1 week) |

### Children 28 Days to 3 Months - Any Fever

!!! warning "Risk: ~6% bacterial infection"

**If infant looks unwell:**

**Full sepsis screen:**
- Urine (CSU, clean catch, or SPA)
- Blood cultures
- FBC
- CSF (see contraindications below)
- CXR

**Admit on IV antibiotics:**
- Amoxicillin (dose as above)
- Ceftriaxone 100 mg/kg Q24H

**If child looks well and feeding satisfactory:**
- FBC
- Blood culture
- Urine (CSU or clean catch)
- CXR if respiratory signs present (grunting, tachypnoea, recession, O₂ requirement)

Consider antibiotics after results reviewed. If unsure, discuss with consultant.

### Children 3 Months to 3 Years - Fever ≥39°C

!!! tip "Clinical Judgement Required"
    Discuss with senior medical staff if uncertain how to proceed

#### A. Clear Clinical Focus in Well-Appearing Child

Child is alert, responsive, and undistressed with obvious source of infection.

**Management:** Treat as clinically indicated. No laboratory investigation usually necessary.

#### B. Child Appears Very Sick

**Any of the following present:**
- Reduced conscious level
- Poor perfusion
- Petechial rash
- Signs of cerebral irritation
- "Looks very sick"

**Full sepsis work up:**
- CXR
- FBC
- Blood culture
- CSF (note contraindications below)
- Urine culture

**Admit for observation and IV antibiotics:**

| Antibiotic | Dose |
|------------|------|
| **Ceftriaxone** | Load: 100 mg/kg, then 100 mg/kg once daily or divided Q12H |

**Additional consideration:**
- Children with focal seizures, focal neurological abnormality, suspected encephalitis, or contact with active herpetic disease should also receive **IV acyclovir**

#### C. Fever Without Focus - Not Severely Unwell

Rate of bacteraemia ~2% (mostly Strep. pneumoniae). Majority resolve spontaneously.

!!! note "Important"
    - FBC and CRP are **not** useful in determining risk of bacterial sepsis in acute presentation
    - **UTI screening mandatory** - prevalence 2-5%, most commonly missed bacterial diagnosis (see MDHB-420)

**Investigations:**
- Urine culture (all patients)
- Blood culture (consider in more unwell children)
- CXR and CSF if indicated by history/examination - discuss with senior doctor

**Special considerations:**
- Children on prior antibiotics are more likely to require CSF despite lack of meningeal signs
- If drowsy after simple febrile seizure but otherwise well → short observation in CAU/ED may suffice
- If discharged, provide febrile seizure handout (e.g., www.kidshealth.org.nz)

## :material-alert-circle: Lumbar Puncture Contraindications

!!! danger "Do NOT perform LP if:"
    - Evidence of raised ICP
    - GCS ≤12
    - Focal neurological signs
    - Cardiovascular instability
    - Widespread purpuric rash
    - Rapid clinical deterioration
