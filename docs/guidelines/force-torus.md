# :material-school: FORCE Trial: Torus Fractures

!!! abstract "Evidence-Based Management"
    The FORCE trial (2022) demonstrated that **removable splints are non-inferior to rigid casts** for paediatric torus (buckle) fractures of the distal radius, with **significantly better comfort and satisfaction**.

## :material-information-outline: What is a Torus Fracture?

- **Mechanism**: Compression injury causing cortical buckling
- **Stability**: Periosteum intact on tension side
- **Healing**: Excellent, typically 3-4 weeks
- **Risk of displacement**: Essentially zero

!!! warning "Not for Greenstick or Complete Fractures"
    This approach is **only for torus (buckle) fractures**. Other fracture patterns require appropriate immobilization.

## :material-arm-flex: Management Approach

!!! success inline end "Quick Decision"
    **Torus fracture confirmed?**
    
    → Optional removable splint
    
    → Regular analgesia
    
    → GP follow-up only

**Confirm diagnosis**: Torus fracture on X-ray (cortical buckle, no breach)

**Immobilization**: Optional removable splint for comfort only

- Many children don't need any splint
- If used: removable wrist splint for 2-3 weeks

**Analgesia**: Regular paracetamol ± ibuprofen as needed

**Activity**: Gentle use as comfort allows, avoid contact sports for 3-4 weeks

**Follow-up**: Routine GP follow-up, no fracture clinic needed

## :material-chat-processing: Patient Communication

!!! tip "What to Tell Parents"
    Torus fractures are **stable injuries** that heal reliably:
    
    - **No cast needed** - a removable splint or bandage provides comfort while healing
    - Child can use the arm gently as comfort allows
    - Expect full recovery in 3-4 weeks
    - Return if increasing pain, swelling, or concerns

## :material-book-open-variant: Clinical Rationale

!!! success "Trial Results at 6 weeks"
    **966 children randomized to removable splint vs. rigid cast:**
    
    - ✅ **Significantly less pain** with splints
    - ✅ **Faster return to activities**
    - ✅ **No difference in re-fracture** or complications
    - ✅ **Higher satisfaction scores**
