# :material-school: FORCE Trial: Torus Fractures

!!! abstract "Evidence-Based Management"
    The FORCE trial (2022) demonstrated that **removable splints are superior to rigid casts** for paediatric torus (buckle) fractures of the distal radius.

## Key Findings

- **Faster return to normal activities** with removable splints
- **Less pain and discomfort** compared to rigid immobilization
- **No difference in healing outcomes**
- **Better patient and parent satisfaction**

## Management Approach

1. **Confirm diagnosis**: Torus fracture on X-ray (cortical buckle, no breach)
2. **Immobilization**: Optional removable splint for comfort only
   - Many children don't need any splint
   - If used: removable wrist splint for 2-3 weeks
3. **Analgesia**: Regular paracetamol ± ibuprofen as needed
4. **Activity**: Gentle use as comfort allows, avoid contact sports for 3-4 weeks
5. **Follow-up**: Routine GP follow-up, no fracture clinic needed

## Patient Communication

!!! tip "What to Tell Parents"
    Torus fractures are **stable injuries** that heal reliably:
    
    - **No cast needed** - evidence shows removable support works better
    - Child can use the arm gently as comfort allows
    - Expect full recovery in 3-4 weeks
    - Return if increasing pain, swelling, or concerns

## Clinical Rationale

### Why No Cast?

The FORCE trial randomized 966 children with distal radius torus fractures to either:

- **Removable splint** (intervention)
- **Rigid cast** (standard care)

**Results at 6 weeks:**

- Significantly less pain with splints
- Faster return to activities
- No difference in re-fracture or complications
- Higher satisfaction scores

### What is a Torus Fracture?

- **Mechanism**: Compression injury causing cortical buckling
- **Stability**: Periosteum intact on tension side
- **Healing**: Excellent, typically 3-4 weeks
- **Risk of displacement**: Essentially zero

!!! warning "Not for Greenstick or Complete Fractures"
    This approach is **only for torus (buckle) fractures**. Other fracture patterns require appropriate immobilization.
