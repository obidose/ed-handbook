## :material-clock-alert-outline: How to manage dental emergencies out of hours

### :material-tooth-outline: Toothache/dry socket/pain

!!! example "Local Anaesthetic Protocol"
    - Inject local anaesthetic around the tooth/site that is sore
    - Articaine best LA for bony infiltration and fast acting
    - Don't inject directly into gums, aim for the tip of the tooth root

### :material-water-alert: Bleeding problems

!!! example "Bleeding Control"
    - Gauze with applied finger pressure for 20 minutes (advise patient not to speak)
    - Surgicel/spongistan placed into the socket
    - TXA soaked gauze with applied pressure

### :material-face-agent: Facial swelling

!!! example "Management Protocol"
    - IV AB's (amoxicillin/augmentin preferred, clindamycin if allergy)
    - Establish a drainage point if possible, or try to massage out some pus

### :material-alert: Dental trauma

!!! example "Trauma Management"
    - Ensure areas are clean
    - Prescribe antibiotics (amoxicillin/augmentin, or clindamycin)
    - Gauze pressure for bleeding

!!! danger "CRITICAL - Avulsed Teeth"
    **IF A PERMANENT TOOTH IS AVULSED PUT IT BACK INTO THE SOCKET**
    
    - The best chance for survival of an avulsed tooth is reimplantation within 60 minutes
    - A tooth can always be realigned later
    
    **DO NOT PLACE A BABY TOOTH BACK INTO A SOCKET**

## :material-home-group: Dental services outside of the hospital

!!! info "Community Dental Access"
    - Most dental practices around have same-day emergency appointments. These get snapped up quickly, so patients are best to call around 7:30am to secure an appointment.
    - Barriers to care is mainly cost and dental anxiety. Several practices offer sedation (patient will need to enquire regarding this). WINZ offers $1,000 for dental treatment and some practices have afterpay/payment plan options.
    - If a patient is seen in private practice they can be referred by their dentist to our services, for example if they require general anaesthetic or are medically compromised and safe care cannot be provided in the community setting.
