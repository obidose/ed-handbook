## :material-alert: High-Risk Features

!!! danger "Immediate CT Required"
    **Any of the following warrant urgent CT head:**
    
    - GCS <14 (or GCS <15 if <1 year old)
    - Focal neurological deficit
    - Signs of skull fracture or basal skull fracture
    - Altered mental state
    - Persistent vomiting (>3 episodes)
    - Post-traumatic seizure
    - Dangerous mechanism (high-speed motor vehicle accident, fall >1m if <2 years, fall >1.5m if ≥2 years)
    - Suspected non-accidental injury

## :material-clock-outline: Observation

### Admission for Observation

Consider admission for:

- Any intracranial injury on CT
- Persistent symptoms despite normal CT
- Difficulty assessing child (e.g., very young, developmental delay)
- Concern about caregiver supervision
- Social concerns

### Discharge Criteria

Safe to discharge if:

- Normal neurological examination
- GCS 15
- No high-risk features
- Reliable caregiver
- Easy access to ED if concerns

### Discharge Information

!!! tip "Patient Information Sheet"
    Provide written concussion advice to all caregivers at discharge.

## :material-head-cog: Concussion Management

### Return to Activity

Graduated return to activity after concussion:

1. **Complete rest** - 24-48 hours
2. **Light activity** - walking, light housework
3. **Moderate activity** - jogging, light swimming
4. **Heavy non-contact** - running, gym work
5. **Full contact practice**
6. **Return to competition**

Progress only if symptom-free at each stage. If symptoms return, drop back to previous level.
