## :material-clock-outline: Contemporaneous Documentation

### Document at Each Stage

!!! warning "Don't Combine Everything Into One Note"
    Document contemporaneously at each stage of the patient journey:
    
    1. **After initial review** - Your assessment, impression, and plan
    2. **After senior discussion** - Who you spoke to, what was agreed
    3. **After new information** - Investigation results, clinical changes
    4. **After plan changes** - Why and what changed
    5. **After referrals/handovers** - Who accepted, what was discussed

### Brief Timestamped Updates

!!! success "Multiple Entries Are Better"
    Add brief timestamped notes any time new information is added or the plan changes. Can be just one line:
    
    ✅ **1630** - Referred to medical reg (Dr Smith) - happy to see patient, asks for urine dip in interim
    
    ✅ **1715** - Bloods back: Hb 72, discussed with Dr Smith, transfusion commenced
    
    ✅ **1800** - Patient reviewed by medical team, accepted for admission

### Why Multiple Entries Matter

!!! info "Timeline Protection"
    Multiple entries are much better than one single entry where the timeline cannot be picked out:
    
    - Gives a **great deal of protection** when something goes wrong
    - Shows an **ongoing process of continual input and review**
    - Demonstrates **appropriate escalation and decision-making**
    - Makes it easy to see what happened when

---

## :material-account-multiple: Include Names and Roles

!!! warning "Always Document Who"
    Make sure to include **names of people discussed with**:
    
    - ✅ "Discussed with Dr Jones (ED Consultant) at 1400"
    - ✅ "Referred to Dr Smith (Medical Registrar)"
    - ✅ "Reviewed by nursing staff, plan communicated to RN Brown"
    
    Not:
    
    - ❌ "Discussed with consultant"
    - ❌ "Referred to medical team"

## :material-scale-balance: Finding the Balance

### When Specifics Matter

!!! example "Include Important Details"
    Some situations require specific detail:
    
    - **Trauma** - Mechanism, forces involved, specific injuries
    - **Chest pain** - Character, radiation, timing, exacerbating factors
    - **Overdose** - Substance, amount, time, intent
    - **Procedures** - Indication, consent, technique, complications
    - **Safeguarding** - Specific concerns, who notified

### Avoid Excessive Detail

!!! tip "Keep It Relevant"
    Too much detail just makes it harder to review a note:
    
    - ❌ "Patient states they had a headache which started on Tuesday morning at approximately 8:15am when they were having breakfast which consisted of toast and eggs..."
    
    - ✅ "Headache started 3 days ago, gradual onset, worsening, associated with photophobia"
    
    Finding this balance **takes time and experience** - don't worry if you're not perfect initially.
