!!! tip "Clinical Line Policy"
    The **[Allocation of Clinical Line Policy](https://midcentraldhb.sharepoint.com/sites/ControlledDocuments/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7b52BC6D6F-426A-4597-BD30-9BCB85DB1485%7d&file=Acute%20Admissions%20and%20Allocation%20of%20Clinical%20Line%20-Policy-.docx&action=default&mobileredirect=true&DefaultItemOpen=1&web=1)** defines the formal process and expectations of different teams, along with specifying which specialty should accept which patient. When presentations don't fit neatly, refer to the most appropriate specialty based on Emergency Physician discretion.

## :material-clock-outline: General Guidelines

- **Referral process**: Once a decision is made that a patient needs admission or specialist input, a referral needs to be made to the appropriate team. 
    - The default approach is to call the registrar of that team.
- **Outpatient referrals** may be more appropriate than acute referrals in some cases
- **When in doubt**, always discuss with a senior on the floor
- Check availability hours before making referrals
