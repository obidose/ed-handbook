# Referrals

Once a decision is made that a patient needs admission to or input from, a specialty team, a referral needs to be made to them. The default aproach is to call the registrar of that team to make the referral.

The allocation of clinical line policy is an agreed focument that defines much of the formal process and expectations of different teams, along with specifying which specialty should accept which patient. Where a presentation does not neatly fit inside of this document, the most appropriate specialty should be referred to. This is based upon the discretion of the Emergency Physician, but if in doubt you should generally talk to a senior on the floor.

In some cases, outpatient referral may be more appropriate than an acute referral.
